# Dashboard

Responsive & interactive dashboard designed to visualize various types of performance and operational data, with a focus on metrics, charts, and a clean, user-friendly interface.
Project has been made to show my basic skills of HTML, CSS, JS and RWD. My inspiration to create that one page of Dashboard was project made in the following link: [https://html.phoenixcoded.net/elite-able](https://html.phoenixcoded.net/elite-able/bootstrap/default/index.html#!).
I didn't recreate that project 1:1 because it was exercise for me, the purpose was refreshing my knowledge about HTML, CSS, JS, RWD and so on. Data for charts has been copied from original source- rest things like HTML, CSS, JS, RWD have been made from ground up.

## üëáBrief summary
- Basic Structure: The page uses semantic HTML5 tags like <!doctype html> and includes a head section with essential meta tags for responsiveness (viewport) and character encoding (UTF-8). It also links external resources such as Google Fonts and stylesheets.

- Styling and Icons: Custom styles are applied for charts, cards, and other UI elements via inline CSS & external CSS. Icons are dynamically loaded using Feather Icons, a popular open-source icon set.

- Charts and Data Visualizations: Several charts are included (such as #average1-chart, #average2-chart, and #time-user), displaying data like visitor metrics, volume, shares, network statistics, and user activity over time.
The amcharts library is used for creating maps and other interactive visual elements, such as location-based visits and sales reports.

- Navigation and Sidebar: A collapsible sidebar (sidepanel) provides navigation to different dashboard sections such as "Analytics," "Sales," "Crypto," and "Project." It can be opened and closed using custom JavaScript functions like openNav() and closeNav().

- Cards with Key Metrics: The dashboard contains cards showing key performance indicators (KPIs) like visitors, shares, orders, network stats, marketing growth, and more. Each card includes icons and data visualizations.

- User and Revenue Stats: A section of the dashboard provides information on user activity by time of day, revenue and expenses, and overall financial performance, with progress bars indicating percentages toward goals.

- JavaScript Integration: JavaScript is used for interactive elements, including handling charts and maps (via amcharts), the collapsible navigation, and dynamically updating statistics.
